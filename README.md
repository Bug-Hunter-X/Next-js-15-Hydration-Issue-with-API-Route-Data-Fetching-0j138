# Next.js 15 Hydration Issue with API Route Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a common hydration issue in Next.js 15 when fetching data from an API route within a page component. The issue manifests as inconsistent rendering, particularly during the initial hydration phase.  The application might display null or undefined data, or simply a blank page, before eventually showing the correct information.

## Problem

The problem lies in the discrepancy between the client-side data fetching (using `fetch`) and the server-side rendering. The server-side render might not have the necessary data in time, leading to hydration mismatches.

## Solution

The solution involves using techniques like data fetching during the `getServerSideProps` function or adopting a loading state to handle the asynchronous nature of data retrieval.   This ensures that data is fetched and ready before the page is rendered on the client.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. Observe the initial rendering, which might show null or undefined before the data appears.
